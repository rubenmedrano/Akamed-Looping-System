# Akamed Looping System
A multi-bank system for live looping in Ableton Live. 
It is a Python script for Ableton and a preset for BOME's MIDI Translator ready for using the MIDI floorboard ROLAND FC-300 to control Ableton Live.
The script allows to have some special functions for Ableton Live and to control them by MIDI, and that's for what BMT is needed, to communicate the MIDI floorboard with Ableton Live. 
If you decide not to use BMT then you should spend your precious time in MIDI mapping by hand...
